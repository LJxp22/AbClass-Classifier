# AbClass-Classifier

This repository contains implementations of multiple machine learning and deep learning algorithms for antibody classification model. 

## Algorithms Included

We used the following algorithms to build different classifiers:

- **AdaBoost**
- **CatBoost**
- **LightGBM**
- **Random Forest**
- **Stacking (Ensemble)**
- **Transformer-based Deep Learning Model**
- **XGBoost**

## Workflow for Each Classifier

For all classification algorithms in this project, the following workflow steps are consistently applied:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
2. **Model Construction**
3. **Model Training**
4. **Testing and Evaluation**
